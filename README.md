To build and run this Flask app in Docker, you can follow these steps:

**Note: Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine before proceeding with these steps.**

1. Open the `requirements.txt` and `app.py` files in the project directory to familiarize yourself with what they contain. These files define the dependencies and the code of the Flask app, respectively.

2. Open the `Dockerfile` file and review its contents. This file contains the instructions for building the Docker image that will run the Flask app.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory where the `Dockerfile` is located.

4. Build the Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-flask-app .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`) and assigns it the tag `my-flask-app`. You can choose a different tag name if you prefer.

5. Once the image is built, you can run a Docker container from the terminal using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```

This command starts a Docker container from the `my-flask-app` image and maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 of the host machine. Adjust the port mapping as needed.

6. The Flask app should now be running in the Docker container. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

**Additional Options:**

- If you want to run the container in the background and assign it a name, you can use the `-d` (detach) and `--name` options:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my_flask_app my-flask-app
```

This command runs the container in the background (`-d`), maps the ports (`-p`), assigns the name `my_flask_app` (`--name`), and specifies the image to use (`my-flask-app`).

With these steps, you can build and run the Flask app in a Docker container.
